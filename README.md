# RTDashboard


Dashboard GUI developed using Java along with a serialized code (jssc libray) connected to Megastim/Arduino via defined port. 


Dashboard itself runs via Python script on a Raspberry PI 3 connected on a waterproof LCD. 

1st page is the main page containing the speed, rpm, temp, fuel, adk indicators. 
2nd page is used to display same readings but with digital display easing the process of data acquisition and debugging.
